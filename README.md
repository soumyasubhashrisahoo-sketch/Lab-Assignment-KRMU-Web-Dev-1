# Lab-Assignment-KRMU-Web-Dev-1
This is a one-page portfolio website built with semantic HTML, featuring sections for About, Projects, Skills, and Contact. It includes a hero introduction, profile image with alt text, a list of projects using <ul> and <article>, and a structured skills table. A functional contact form with labels, placeholders, and required fields ensures usability, while accessibility features like internal navigation links and a “Skip to main content” option improve user experience. The code is clean and semantic, using <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> to allow for easy styling and scalability. The goal of this project is to create a simple, accessible, and future-ready portfolio that effectively represents personal growth in web development.
