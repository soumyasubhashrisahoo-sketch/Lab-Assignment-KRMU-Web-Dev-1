        <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
        <h3>MY name is SOUMYA SUBHASHRI SAHOO</h3>
        <p>Hello! I’m Soumya, a first-semester B.Tech CSE student in AI and ML, Section B.
            A little about me — I love talking (and yapping), so hopefully this doesn’t turn into a blog! I’m completely
            hooked on building websites,
            and HTML has quickly become my favorite thing to work with. Thanks to our professors for introducing me to
            it, but honestly,
            it just feels fun and a little magical. Let’s explore my work and projects through this portfolio!
            own website!</p>
        <article id="hero">
            <h1>!! HERO SECTION !!</h1>
            <p>I love to call myself the hero of my life , this is not overconfidence but self love and respect for
                myself and my time in this planet .
                A turning point in how I see myself came after watching I Want to Eat Your Pancreas (anime).
                That experience changed the way I value time, helped me learn to respect myself, and made me realize
                that I have power to change the world by changing myself.
                Being my own hero means taking responsibility, moving forward despite challenges, and shaping the path I
                want to walk , what i do will be remembered so i want to
                give my best . </p>

            <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
            <img src="PICTURE1.jpg" alt="picture of me">
            <p>I’m a first-semester B.Tech CSE student in AI and ML, Section B.
                I’ve recently discovered my passion for technology, especially web development, and I enjoy creating
                websites that bring ideas to life.
                HTML has become my favorite tool to experiment with because it feels both simple and magical.
                Beyond coding, I’m someone who loves colors, creativity, and challenging myself , even if it means
                failing a most of the times .
                I believe that every small step shapes who I am becoming, and through this portfolio, I want to share my
                journey, my projects,
                and the way I’m learning to grow as both a student and a creator.</p>
