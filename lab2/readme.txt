This project is a personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. It highlights my profile, skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and organized layout. The website structure was built using semantic HTML elements such as header, section, article, and footer to ensure clarity and accessibility. An external CSS file was linked to maintain consistent styling throughout the site.

The navigation bar was styled with proper spacing and link formatting to create an easy and smooth browsing experience. Margins, padding, and font styles were applied to enhance readability and visual balance. The skills table and contact form were formatted with borders, padding, and input styling for a neat appearance. Hover effects, buttons, and simple visual elements like borders and shadows were added to improve interactivity. Overall, this project demonstrates the use of basic web design principles, clean structure, and external styling to create a functional and visually appealing personal portfolio.
